# Phase III: Todo AI Chatbot

Basic Level Functionality

## Objective

Create an AI-powered chatbot interface for managing todos through natural language using MCP (Model Context Protocol) server architecture and using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Development Approach

Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.

## Requirements

- Implement conversational interface for all Basic Level features
- Use OpenAI Agents SDK for AI logic
- Build MCP server with Official MCP SDK that exposes task operations as tools
- Stateless chat endpoint that persists conversation state to database
- AI agents use MCP tools to manage tasks. The MCP tools will also be stateless and will store state in the database.
